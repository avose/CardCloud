CardCloud
=========

"Web users share a virtual simulation of physical cards."


For now, one can get started with the example deck file, "deck.txt".
Also, a development version is (might be) available at:
http://aaronvose.net/cardcloud .
Please see the CardCloud GitHub Wiki page for more information, and the GitHUB Issue Tracker for current goals.
